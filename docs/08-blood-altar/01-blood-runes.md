There's lots of different runes. They do cool stuff! Try mixing and matching to see what works best for you.


## Acceleration Rune {#acceleration-rune}

The Acceleration Rune increases the rate of a couple operations. While normally the operations of the [Charging Rune](#charging-rune) and [Displacement Rune](#displacement-rune) occur every 20 ticks, one tick of the delay is removed per rune, down to a minimum of 1 operation per tick.

With some Netherite Scrap and some [Intricate Hellforged Parts](#intricate-hellforged-parts) looted from the [Demon Realm](#dungeon-delving), you can double the power of your Acceleration Rune, removing two ticks per rune instead of one, freeing up other slots around your altar.

## Charging Rune {#charging-rune}

The Charging Rune is a unique Rune upgrade. When the [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) is neither crafting nor filling a [Blood Orb](#soul-network), it will syphon LP from the Altar to charge an internal buffer. When an item is next placed inside of the Altar, it will instantaneously consume the stored charge and apply it to the crafting of the item at a 1:1 ratio.

The Blood Altar does a charging tick once per 20 in-game ticks, which is reduced by 1 per [Acceleration Rune.](#acceleration-rune)

The speed that the Blood Altar charges at per charging tick is:

10LP x [Charging Runes](#charging-rune) x (1 + [Speed Runes](#speed-rune) / 10).

The maximum charge that a Blood Altar can hold is 1000 LP per Charging Rune, which is then multiplied by:

(capacity of the main Blood Altar tank) / 20000

If that value is above 1.
