$(item)Ritual Stones$() are the canvas upon which you will draw your $(item)Rituals$(). They also look quite nifty, and can be manually painted with the various $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_diviner)Elemental Inscription Tools$(). $(br2)Note that the Inscription Tools used to have durability, but now they last forever! Rejoice, you can decorate your base with $(fire)Fire Ritual Stones$() to your heart's content.
