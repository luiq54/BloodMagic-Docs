By default, the $()Ritual of Magnetism$() searches down to bedrock in a radius of 3 blocks out from the $(item)Master Ritual Stone$() for ores to collect. This can be augmented by placing an expensive block directly underneath the MRS, as follows: $(br)$(li)$(item)Block of Iron$() - 7 blocks. $(li)$(item)Block of Gold$() - 15 blocks. $(li)$(item)Block of Diamond$() - 31 blocks.
