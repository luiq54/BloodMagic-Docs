The $(thing)Rythm of the Beating Anvil$() is a powerful and versatile ritual, allowing you to autocraft standard crafting recipes alongside recipes using your $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/alchemy_table)Alchemy Table$() or $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_forge)Hellfire Forge$() (If properly augmented). However, it can be a little complex, so what follows is a tutorial for setting it up. $(br2)Each ritual can handle exactly one recipe.

First off, we need to specify the recipe that we want the ritual to craft. This is done using an Item Filter. $(br2)Multiple types of Item Filter can be used, however the ritual will only ever accept one filter at a time; any additional filters will be ignored.

The following filters are accepted: $(li)Standard Item Filter: specifies exactly which item to use in each slot. $(li)Tag Item Filter: Uses $(thing)Tags$() to specify what items to use. E.G. If a recipe requires any kind of stone (but will work with andesite, granite, etc), you can use forge:stone in the filter. $(li)Mod Item Filter: This will try to use any item from the mod in this slot.

Next, the Item Filter has to be placed on the ritual. In this image we've used an $(item)Item Frame$(), however a chest can be used instead. Note that if you put multiple $(item)filters$() in the chest, only the first one will be used. $(br2)By default, the Input chest and Output chest are in the same place; however, this can be changed with the $(l:bloodmagic/rituals/ritual_tinkerer)Ritual Tinkerer.$() This can be useful for recipes that re-use some components, such as your $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Blood Orb.$()

If you supply the ritual with $(steadfast)Steadfast$() or $(corrosive)Corrosive$() Will, then the ritual will instead try to autocraft with a linked $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_forge)Hellfire Forge$() or $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/alchemy_table)Alchemy Table$(), respectively. These recipes are all shapeless, but if you need 2 of an item, you'll have to specify it twice in the filter.
