This ritual attacks mobs within its damage zone and puts the harvested $(blood)Blood$() into a nearby $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_altar)Blood Altar$(). Put a $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Blood Orb$() in the Altar, maybe add a few $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_rune/sacrifice_rune)Runes of Sacrifice$() for good measure and you'll never have to worry about your LP supplies again... As long as you can supply enough mobs.
