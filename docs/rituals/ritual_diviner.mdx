Crafting rituals is an intricate business; Even if you have the correct $(item)Inscription Tools$(), you can't just slap runic inscriptions down any old how and expect things to happen. Luckily, the $(item)Ritual Diviner$() is here to help. $(br2)Hold [$(k:sneak)] and press [$(k:use)] or [$(k:attack)] while looking at empty air to cycle through the avaliable rituals in either direction.
you can also change the direction that the completed ritual will face by pressing [$(k:use)]. This will only affect a small number of rituals, such as the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_speed)Ritual of Speed$(), as most rituals are symmetrical.
The Ritual Diviner can break replaceable blocks (like tall grass, snow, etc), but not solid ones such as stone or dirt, so make sure the area is clear before you commence construction, or the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/activation_crystals)Activation Crystal$() will be unable to do its job. $(br2)It's also worth noting that the base ritual diviner can only create some of the more basic rituals. If you want the most out of your diviner, you'll have to upgrade it with $(dusk)Dusk Inscription Tools$().
The base Ritual Diviner requires one of each $(item)Elemental Inscription Tool$() for its construction, and thus a tier 3 $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_altar)Blood Altar$(/l). $(br2)The four base Elemental Inscription Tools can be crafted in your Altar for $(blood)1,000 LP$() each, as defined on the following pages. The Ritual Diviner [Dusk] similarly requires a Tier 4 Altar to make two Dusk Elemental Inscription Tools, at a cost of $(blood)2,000 LP$() each.
You can also use these tools to inscribe runes by hand, but this should only seriously be used for decorative purposes, as it is both slow and inaccurate.
