The basics of $(thing)Potion Crafting$() are known to all and sundry throughout the land. Even common Clerics and Witches have a firm grasp of the basics of brewing - take a handful of semi-rare ingredients, mix them together in the correct proportions, and consume the result (while holding your nose, if needed), or throw it at your foes.
The addition of $(blood)Life Essence$() and some frankly ingenious Sanguimancy has allowed you to turbocharge the practice, however. $(br2)By imbuing ordinary $(item)Glass Bottles$() with your powers, you are able to hold far more than a single swig of liquid, and with the use of various $(item)Catalysts$() you have figured out how to combine multiple effects in one flask without them muddying together and cancelling out.
Of course, a bottle, no matter how advanced, is all but useless without something to fill it. $(br2)Alongside all the usual well known $(thing)Effects$() such as $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/water_breathing)Water Breathing$(), $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/regeneration)Regeneration$(), or $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/night_vision)Night Vision$(), we have also perfected a variety of other, more specialised recipes, such as $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/flight)Flight$(), $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/obsidian_cloak)Obsidian Cloak$(), or even $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/passive)Passive$(). These potions and many more are documented further on in the book.
Flasks also have their equivalent to $(thing)Splash$() and $(thing)Lingering Potions$(), see overleaf. $(br2)$(thing)Lingering Potions$() can be combined with 8 $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/throwing_daggers#amethyst_throwing_dagger)Amethyst Throwing Daggers$() in the $(item)Alchemical Reaction Chamber$() to create $(item)Tipped Amethyst Throwing Daggers$(). Any entity hit by one of these daggers will have the potion's effects transferred to it.
You may recall me mentioning the ability to make multiple $(thing)effects$() in a single $(item)Flask$(). Luckily, this process couldn't be easier. Simply brew up a potion, and use the resulting Flask in place of your empty Flask in the second brewing. For example, if you made a Flask of $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/bounce)Bounce$(), then took that flask and used it as an ingredient in a flask of $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/night_vision)Night Vision$(), you'd end up with an 8-dose Flask that gives you $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/bounce)Bounce$() and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/night_vision)Night Vision$() with every swig!
Next up, we have $(item)Catalysts$(). There are a few kinds of catalyst, with a few different effects, so let's start off with the simplest three - $(item)Simple Catalyst$(), $(item)Small Power Catalyst$(), and $(item)Small Lengthening Catalyst$(). Of these, the first is the most straightforward - it provides a base to almost every Alchemical Potion, much as $(item)Nether Wart$() does for standard Potions.
If the potions you've crafted so far just aren't enough for you, then perhaps you need to do a little exploring? With some $(item)Glow berries$(), some $(item)Cobbled Deepslate$() and a sprinkling of $(l:bloodmagic:dungeons/demonite)Hellforged Sand$(), you can boost the duration and power of your flasks significantly.
