$(item)Anointments$() are essentially $(item)potions$() for your tools, weapons, and even your $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/explosive_charges)Charges$(). By Pressing [$(k:use)] with the $(item)anointment$() in one hand, it will be applied to the item in your other hand, if possible. Not all anointments work on all equipment! $(br2)Unlike $(item)potions$(), $(item)anointments$() aren't timed; rather, they wear off a bit at a time as your tool or weapon is used.
