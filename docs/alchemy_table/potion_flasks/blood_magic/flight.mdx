$(thing)Flight$() gives the target a temporary dose of creative-style Flight, similar to if they were within the range of the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_condor)Reverence of the Condor$() ritual. Higher levels increase flight speed. $(br2)It's created from a flask containing both the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/suspended)Suspended$() and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/levitation)Levitation$() effects.

adding $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potions#average_potions)Standard Catalysts$() can further boost your potions.
