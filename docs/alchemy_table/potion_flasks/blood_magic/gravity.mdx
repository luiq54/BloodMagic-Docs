$(thing)Gravity$() cause the target to fall faster and take more damage on landing. It does not reduce jump height, however. $(br2)It's created from a flask containing both the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/grounded)Grounded$() and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/slow_falling)Slow Falling$() effects.
adding $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potions#average_potions)Standard Catalysts$() can further boost your potions.
