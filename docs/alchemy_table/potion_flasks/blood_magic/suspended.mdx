$(thing)Suspended$() prevents the target from jumping, falling, or being affected by gravity in any way whatsoever. They can still move, however, sliding about as though on a flat, never-ending plane of ice. $(br2)It's made from a potion of $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/gravity)Gravity$().
