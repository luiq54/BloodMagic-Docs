$(thing)Heavy Heart$() drags the target steadily downwards, making flying and swimming significantly more difficult. $(br2)It's created from a flask containing both the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/blood_magic/gravity)Gravity$() and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potion_flasks/vanilla/instant_health)Instant Health$() effects.
adding $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potions#average_potions)Standard Catalysts$() can further boost your potions.
