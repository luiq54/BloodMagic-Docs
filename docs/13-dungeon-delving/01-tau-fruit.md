title: Tau Fruit
---

Tau Fruit can be found within [Simple Dungeons](#heading=h.y9bhy9y8r2f4), after which it can be farmed. Being a native denizen of the Demon Realm, its lifecycle is unfortunately a tad more complex than that of the humble Potato.

The Tau Fruit will mature into one of two varieties, depending on the conditions in which it was raised. By default, it will grow into Tau Fruit, which can be converted into Tau Oil.

_Tastes like a Blood Orange, except different._

Tau Oil currently has two main uses. It can extend the duration of any [anointment](#anointments) by a factor of four, or it can be used to craft Intermediate Cutting Fluid, which functions similarly to [Basic Cutting Fluid](#alchemical-reaction-chamber), but lasts eight times longer and provides a 25% speed boost.


## Saturated Tau {#saturated-tau}

However, Tau Fuit has an alternate, more challenging route of growth. If the plant matures while a Mob (a cow, for example) is standing atop it, it will leach health from the entity to satiate its dark hunger. In this way, Saturated Tau can be grown.
