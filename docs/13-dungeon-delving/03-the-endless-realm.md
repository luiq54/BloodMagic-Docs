title: The Endless Realm
---

Much as with its little brother, the [Edge of the Hidden Realm](#edge-of-the-hidden-realm) ritual, you can access the Demon Realm proper with the [Pathway to the Endless Realm](#pathway-to-the-endless-realm). you will once again find yourself looking at an _Inversion Pillar_. As with the [Antechamber](#the-antechamber), you'll find a simple loot chest left by a careless demon (or perhaps a less-lucky sanguimancer) and a number of doorways, alongside another Inversion Pillar to return you home.

These dungeon rooms will be filled with more fearsome foes than you found in the antechamber, and will have loot to match. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for any Spatial Distortions, as well as rare [keys](#dungeon-keys) such as the Foreman's Key.

Spatial Distortions will announce themselves with a chat message - if you see one of these messages, it means the room you're in has a very special lock. Currently, it will be either the entrance to The Mines, or the entrance to a small room containing The Foreman's Key, which can be opened with an Iron Key. The Mine entrance will always spawn before the key, so some backtracking might be needed.


## The Foreman's Key

_This door can be opened with an Iron Key, and hides the Foreman's Key behind it._


## The Mine Entrance

_This door can only be opened with the Foreman's Key. You may need to backtrack!_

The Foreman's Key will allow entrance into _The Mines_, which is another step up in both difficulty and rewards. Along with [Demonite Ore](#demonite), which is essential for high tier [potioncrafting](#potion-crafting) and [the Tier-5 Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) and its accompanying [Orb](#soul-network), you'll find scads of more mundane loot, enchanted weapons and tools, anointments, potions, and more.

Explore enough, and you may be lucky enough to find _Intricate Hellforged Parts_, which can be used to double the power of your existing Runes. It's like having two Blood Altarsin one!
