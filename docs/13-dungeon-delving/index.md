Perform the [Edge of the Hidden Realm](#edge-of-the-hidden-realm) ritual to gain a foothold in the Demon realm. This dangerous place is full of threats, traps, and treasure!


## Demonite {#demonite}

_Demonite Ore_ can only be found within Dungeons, specifically in The Mines, accessed by finding a Foreman's Key somewhere within the mazelike structure and using it to unlock a Spatial Distortion. It can be used to make Hellforged Ingots or Hellforged Sand.

When mined with Silk Touch, the ore can be harvested directly, but otherwise, it will drop clumps of Raw Demonite.

## Dungeon Keys

_Keys_ are the initial way of navigating Dungeons. They can be found inside Dungeon chests within the Demon Realm, or they can be crafted. The most basic kind are Iron Keys, which spawn inside The Antechamber as well as within the closest levels of the Demon Realm proper.

Eventually, you may come across a _Spatial Distortion_ when searching through a Dungeon. These will either lead you to a unique, uncraftable key, or to a door that only said key can open. Spatial Distortions only form within the Demon Realm proper, and you will never find them within an Antechamber."


## The Mines {#the-mines}

The entrance to _The Mines_ can only be opened with the uncraftable _Foreman's Key_, while all other doors beyond that can be opened with Miner's Keys. The mines will grant you access to [Demonite ore](#demonite) alongside some rarer loot, but comes with challenges to match.

_If it's so simple, why can't we just pick the lock?_
