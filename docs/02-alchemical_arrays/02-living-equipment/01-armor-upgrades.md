A list of available Living Armour Upgrades.


:::info
Wrince also made a [separate little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQV8H3QtlcfpgktPnVMmxXPnXY1TTBgEnAvvoT4lRq0/edit#gid=1047551065) for planning out living armour upgrades. This sheet contains details on the costs and benefits of each level of upgrade. Details for exact costs, level caps, etc, might be changed by your modpack, so check your manual to be certain!

## Body Builder {#body-builder}

**Effect:** Grants Knockback Resistance and bonus Health.

Caps out at 100% Resistance and 10 half-hearts of health.

**Trained by:** Eating food.

**Maximum level:** 5


## Charging Strike {#charging-strike}

**Effect: **Increases damage and knockback from sprinting attacks, up to +50%.

## Socketed {#socketed}

Adds Living Armour Socket Curios Slots to the player that are able to hold compatible Blood Magic items.

## Dwarven Might {#dwarven-might}

**Effect:** Increases mining speed while mining identical blocks. After a certain level, gives a Haste buff after breaking blocks.

**Trained by: **Mining.

**Maximum level:** 10


## Elytra {#elytra}

Adds an Elytra to your Living Armour. Rather than being trained, the [Upgrade Tome](#upgrade-tomes) must be crafted.

This Elytra does drain durability from the Chestplate, but at half the speed of a normal Elytra.

It also looks pretty neat.
