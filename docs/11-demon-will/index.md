Demonic will is strange stuff. Untapped, it seems to coalesce around entities, but it can be tapped, harnessed, and controlled. This chapter lays out the underlying concepts and advanced techniques for Demon Will manipulation.

## Your First Will

Soul Snares are your gateway into the [Demon Will](#demon-will) portion of Blood Magic.

Using the Snare is simple enough - craft a good quantity of them and throw them at _hostile mobs_. White particle effects will appear around them; then it's time to go in for the kill. On death, they will drop a chunk of [Demon Will](#demon-will). Before you ask, yes, the Looting enchantment will increase the amount of Will dropped. Once you've gathered a couple, you can get to work on crafting yourself a [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword) and a [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems) - these will make collecting [Demon Will](#demon-will) much easier.

Once you have a [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar), you'll need to gather a few _Demon Wills_. There are two ways to get Demon Will:

* Killing a mob that has been hit with a [Soul Snare](#your-first-will) and is killed when white particle effects appear.
* By killing a hostile mob with a [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword).

Since you are just beginning to use the mod, you will not yet have a Sentient Sword and thus will need to use a [Soul Snare](#your-first-will).

_Demon Will_ is a recurring resource in Blood Magic, and is used to power the [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge).

In the lore of Blood Magic, Demon Will is the residual effect of when a demon imbues its will into the bodies of the dead or other monsters.

Once you have some Will, you can use it to craft useful tools in the [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge). If you find them cluttering up your inventory, perhaps a [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems) may help.


## Hellfire Forge {#hellfire-forge}

The Hellfire Forge is one of the core crafting mechanics of Blood Magic, alongside the [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) itself. Here, you can work with the [Demon Will](#demon-will) you have harvested from mobs, to allow you to create [Sentient Tools](#sentient-tools), including the [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword), [Tartaric Gems](#tartaric-gems), various reagents, [Arcane Ash](#arcane-ash), and many things besides.
