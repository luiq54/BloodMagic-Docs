title: Demon Will Aspects
---

Unleashing [Demon Will](#demon-will) into the atmosphere was definitely an excellent idea. Not only has it proven most useful in empowering [Rituals](#rituals), you have also successfully condensed it into a [Crystal Cluster](#crystallized-will), and are wondering what to turn your eye to next.

These _Crystals_ feel somehow... conflicted, to you. A certain [Ritual](#heading=h.ijvx5p6b26uy) may help coax them out into purer forms...

_The [Resonance of the Faceted Crystal](#heading=h.ijvx5p6b26uy) ritual in action._

Now we have _Crystallized Will_ in four spicy new flavours! on the Water Rune we have Steadfast Will, on the Air Rune we get Destructive Will, on the Fire Rune comes Vengeful Will and on the Earth Rune we find Corrosive Will.

These various new types of Will can be burned in the Demon Crucible just like Raw Will, and from there can be fed into various Rituals to great and fascinating effect.

They also change how your Sentient Tools behave, making them more powerful.

* **Raw Will**: Increases damage and attack speed.
* **Corrosive Will**: Attacks have a chance to apply poison or wither to your foes, otherwise same as Raw.
* **Vengeful Will**: increases damage, but not as much as Raw. Increases attack speed more than any other type. Gives a movement speed buff that increases with higher amounts of Will.
* **Steadfast Will**: Increases damage (but not as much as Raw) and grants Absorption after a kill.
* **Destructive Will**: Increases damage more than any other will type, but increases attack speed more slowly than any other type. Top Tier is still faster than an unempowered tool / equivalent iron tool, but slower than any other will type."

You may be wondering: "How on earth do I get this will into a usable form?" Well, the answer is simple. Just place an EMPTY [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems) into a [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge) in the same chunk as a _Demon Crucible_, then feed the Demon Crucible with Will Crystals of the desired aspect. Your [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems) will fill with that aspect of will. You can change which kind of will your Sentient Tools use by right-clicking while holding them.

Note that your Sentient Tools will take on the aspect of the largest amount of Will in your inventory. If you're carrying 10 Corrosive Will in one Tartaric Gem, and 1,000 Raw Will in another, then your sword will remain Raw.
