title: Alchemical Arrays
---

<p>Alchemy Arrays are simple effects that originate from circles that are drawn on the ground using <a href="#arcane-ash">Arcane Ashes</a>. They are simple to build and can be really useful in both early game and late game applications</p>

## Arcane Ash {#arcane-ash}

Arcane Ashes are an item that is pivotal in the creation of Alchemy Arrays. Arcane Ashes can be crafted in the [Alchemy Table](#the-alchemy-table) using some early game items.

 In order to create an Alchemy Array, press right-click (by default)  while looking at a block with the Arcane Ashes in hand. This will consume 1 durability out of 20 from the Arcane Ashes and draw a simple Alchemy Array, that by itself has no effects.

When you click on the Alchemy Array, it will consume a single item from the stack in your hand and hold it in the array. These items are then used to determine the Alchemy Array's effect."

*An Alchemy Array showing the array with: no inputs; only the base item; both base and catalyst.*

Each effect requires two items: a base and a catalyst. The base is the first item that you click the array with after it is drawn, and the catalyst is the second item. When you apply the base item, the design of the array will change if it is valid, and the array will activate once you apply the catalyst."

Although only a few arrays are currently implemented, eventually you will have arrays that range from simple [crafting arrays](#crafting-with-arrays) to even teleportation arrays.


## Crafting With Arrays {#crafting-with-arrays}

Alchemy Arrays of Crafting are one of the simplest forms of array. These arrays inscribe the base item onto the catalyst, transforming them both into a useful item (after a small, pretty animation).

While some of these resulting items can be crafted [using very simple ingredients](#divination-sigil), others require additional steps to create useful items.


## Movement Arrays {#movement-arrays}

The Movement Arrays are a pair of arrays that throws players, mobs, items, etc in a specific direction.  One will throw the items horizontally, while the other will throw them vertically.

## Spike Array {#spike-array}

The Spike Array is a rather simple array with a single purpose. When a living entity steps into the array, they are hit with a full heart of damage. This is good for mob traps, or for making your base a bit spikier for players.


## Time Arrays {#time-arrays}

Time-based arrays are straight-forward arrays that control the time of day. The items will be consumed once the array starts changing the time. These recipes are temporary and will change in the future.

The Day array will change the time of day to the next sunrise. The Night array will change the time of day to the next sunset.
