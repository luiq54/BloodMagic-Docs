The $(item)Sigil of the Fast Miner$() is a Sigil that, when activated using [$(k:sneak)] and [$(k:use)], will consume $(blood)100 LP$() every 5 seconds and apply the Haste potion effect. Thus, it increases your mining, digging, and cutting speeds. Crafted using the $(item)Mining Reagent$() and $(item)Reinforced Slate$() in an alchemy array.
As you have the $(thing)Curios API$() installed, you can equip this $(item)Sigil$() as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using a $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/sigil/holding)Sigil of Holding$(), or the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/curios_sockets)Socketed Upgrade$() for your $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/living_basics)Living Armour$().
