Increases the player's item pickup range to 7 blocks when active. Toggle on/off by holding the Sigil in your hand, and then holding [$(k:sneak)] and pressing [$(k:use)]. $(br2)Consumes 50 $(blood)LP$() every 5 seconds while active.

As you have the $(thing)Curios API$() installed, you can equip this $(item)Sigil$() as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using a $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/sigil/holding)Sigil of Holding$(), or the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/curios_sockets)Socketed Upgrade$() for your $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/living_basics)Living Armour$().
