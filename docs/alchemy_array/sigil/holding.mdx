This Sigil can hold up to 5 other $(item)Sigils$() at a time, providing you with their passive effects and allowing you to activate them on a whim.$(br)Press [$(k:bloodmagic.keybind.open_holding)] while holding the Sigil to open its inventory.$() $(br)Press [$(k:bloodmagic.keybind.cycle_holding_pos)] to cycle forward,$() or [$(k:bloodmagic.keybind.cycle_holding_neg)] to cycle backwards.$() holding [$(k:sneak)] and using your mousewheel also works.
As you have the $(thing)Curios API$() installed, you can equip this $(item)Sigil$() as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using the $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/curios_sockets)Socketed Upgrade$() for your $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/living_basics)Living Armour$().
