Throws you in the direction you're facing, at a cost of $(blood)50 LP$() per use. Note that this does not provide any sort of Feather Falling effect, so be careful when landing! A good way to get around quickly, albeit with some risk. Many an unwary mage has met their end by running out of $(blood)LP$() in their $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Soul Network$() while flying miles above the countryside.
