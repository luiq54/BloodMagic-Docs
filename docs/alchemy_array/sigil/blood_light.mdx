The $(item)Sigil of the Blood Lamp$() is a handy tool for any miner, dungeon delver, or simply any Sanguimancer that doesn't like dark patches and feels that torches and glowstone blocks get in the way. When used, this sigil launches a Blood Light in the direction you are facing. When it hits a block, it spawns a nearly-invisible light source at a cost of $(blood)10 LP$().
