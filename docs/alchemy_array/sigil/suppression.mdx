The $(item)Sigil of Suppression$(), when activated via pressing [$(k:use)], will temporarily obliviate all fluids in a roughly 6-block radius of its holder. A short while after moving away from the liquid in question, it will return as though it never left. While this will make exploring the lava oceans of the Nether much easier, beware of jumping into any deep pools of water with this active!
