The $(item)Water Sigil$() is a rather simple sigil. When you press [$(k:use)] while looking at a block, you can drain 100LP from your $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Soul Network$(/l) to place a source block of water in the world. If there's not enough LP, it will instead drain the toll from your health. Crafted using a $(item)Water Reagent$() and a $(item)Blank Slate.$()
