To create $(item)Living Equipment$(), you will first need $(item)Iron Armor$() (or $(item)Iron Armour$(), if you prefer), some $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/functional_arrays/arcane_ash)Arcane Ash$(), and some $(item)Binding Reagent$(). You'll also need at least a $(br)$(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_gem)Common Tartaric Gem$() in order to hold the $(item)Demon Will$() required.
as with any other Alchemy Array, press [$(k:use)] while looking at a block with the $(item)Arcane Ashes$() in hand, then apply the $(item)Binding Reagent$(). Then place in your $(item)Iron Helmet$(), $(item)Iron Chestplate$(), $(item)Iron Leggings$() or $(item)Iron Boots$(), stand back, and watch the show.$(br2) Living Equipment starts off equivalent to Iron, but it has $(thing)Upgrade Points$() that can, with care, be spent to train it in specific ways. It starts with 100, but there may be ways to surpass this limitation...
