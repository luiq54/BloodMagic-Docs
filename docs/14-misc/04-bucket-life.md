title: Bucket of life
---

Life Essence is all fine and good in the [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar), where it can be used for crafting or funnelled into an [Orb](#soul-network) to power Rituals, but what if you want to build a moat of the stuff around your [Incense Altar](#incense-altar)? Fortunately, extracting Life Essence is relatively trivial. Simply place a Bucket in the [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) and wait a few seconds for it to fill up. 1 LP=1mb, so 1,000 LP should be plenty for your Bucket.

_... Why are you looking at me like that?_
