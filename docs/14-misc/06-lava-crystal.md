title: Lava Crystal

The Lava Crystal is a source of great heat. Between the lava used in its creation and the power of your [Soul Network](#soul-network), you feel confident that it will never cool.

Right-clicking while looking at any block in the world will ignite it, at a cost of 100 LP.

Furthermore, if placed in the fuel slot of a Furnace, it will act as a never-ending fuel source, consuming 50LP to burn for 10 seconds, or long enough to cook one item.
