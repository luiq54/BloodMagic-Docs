The Alchemical Reaction Chamber isn't fully implemented yet, but among other things it can function as a Furnace, offers a form of [Ore-Tripling](#basic-ore-processing), can revert [Blood Orbs](#soul-network), Netherrite and Reinforced Runes, and is currently the only way to get Weak Blood Shards, specifically from a [Saturated Tau](#heading=h.i7uo4woy6qvz).

## Sanguine Reverter

The _Sanguine Reverter_ is used to create Weak Blood Shards, and revert Blood Orbs, Netherrite and Reinforced Runes to their input crafting item.

All Reinforced Runes can be reverted this way - this is just a demonstration.
