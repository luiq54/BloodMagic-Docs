## Tiers & Getting Started {#tiers-&-getting-started}

Blood Magic 3's progression is still being reworked, and the first few steps are significantly different from Blood Magic 2's.

We are still retooling our guidance, but we are waiting until the progression is locked down. In the meantime, here is a quick overview on how to progress in this beta version of Blood Magic 3."

**Blood Altar (Tier-1)**

The first step of Blood Magic is to build a [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) and a Sacrificial Knife. Use these to generate LP from Self-Sacrificing.

Use this LP to craft a [Weak Blood Orb](#soul-network), several [Blank Slates](#slates), and a few [Soul Snares](#your-first-will).

**Alchemy Table (Tier-1)**

The [Alchemy Table](#alchemy-table) uses LP from a player's Soul Network (drawn from the [bound Blood Orb](#soul-network) in it) to craft various different objects, such as:

* [Arcane Ashes](#arcane-ash)
* Reagents for Sigils
* [Anointments](#anointments)
* 2x Ore Processing
* and various other odds and ends.

**Alchemy Array (Tier-1)**

An Alchemy Array is made by placing some [Arcane Ashes](#arcane-ash) on the ground. The Alchemy Array can have 2 items inserted into it via right clicking, and will either craft an item (such as a [Divination Sigil](#divination-sigil)) or perform some kind of function (such as [turning day into night](#time-arrays)).

**Hellfire Forge (Tier-1)**

The [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge) crafts using [Demon Will](#demon-will). You get your first Will by using [Soul Snares](#your-first-will), though upgrading to a [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword) is recommended. The Hellfire Forge is used for stuff directly related to Demon Will (like [Tartaric Gems](#tartaric-gems) and [Sentient Tools](#sentient-tools)), and consumables (like [Explosive Charges](#explosive-charges) and [Throwing Daggers](#throwing-daggers)).

**Tier Two**

At this point, you will be able to craft a _Dagger of Sacrifice_ in order to slaughter mobs for more LP. Various Upgrade Runes should be available for your [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar), and some more Sigils will be available. As before, you should focus on further upgrading your Altar.

**Potioncrafting (Tier-2)**

If building your [Altar](#the-blood-altar) is getting tiresome and you feel in need of a distraction, why not try out the newly available [Potioncrafting](#potion-crafting) system?  you will be able to craft Alchemy Flasks and imbue them with literally dozens of effects.

**Tier Three**

By this point, you will have the ability to create some basic [Rituals](#rituals-getting-started) and [Living Armour](#living-basics) as well. This armour is very versatile, though you'll have to work hard to unlock its full potential. At this point you should look into upgrading your [Altar](#the-blood-altar) and your [Ritual Diviner](#ritual-diviner) to unlock more powerful Rituals. How, you say?

**Dungeoneering (Tier-3)**

By performing the [Edge of the Hidden Realm](#edge-of-the-hidden-realm), that's how! This will allow you limited access to the Demon Realm, and hopefully to [Tau Fruit](#heading=h.i7uo4woy6qvz), which can be cultivated into _Saturated Tau_ and then converted into Weak Blood Shards in the [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber). These can be used to make the Tier IV Altar, more powerful [Anointments](#anointments), and [Potion Catalysts](#potion-crafting).

**Tier Four**

You may want to look into the [Ritual Tinkerer](#ritual-tinkerer) and the various kinds of [Will Aspects](#demon-will-aspects) available to you, and consider how they may be used to refine your existing rituals and alter how your [Sentient Tools](#sentient-tools) and [Weapons](#sentient-sword) work. To progress beyond this point, however, a delve into the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_standard_dungeon)Demon Realm$() will be needed…

**The Demon Realm (Tier-4)**

By performing the _Pathway to the Endless Realm_, you can gain access to the _Demon Realm_ proper, along with all of its treasures and terrors. Come equipped for a fight! Delve deep, and you may find a rich source of $(l:bloodmagic:dungeons/demonite)Demonite Ore$(), which can be combined into block form and used for the capstones on your altar, along with the _Archmage's Blood Orb_.

**Tier Five**

This is the top tier. At this point you have access to everything that Blood Magic has to offer. Continue to delve into the Demon Realm to hunt for rare treasures, and you may be lucky enough to find _Intricate Hellforged Parts_, which can be used alongside some_Netherite Scrap_ to double the power of each of your altar's Runes!

**Tier Six?**

What? No. Look, even in 1.12, this only existed as a favour to pack makers and was otherwise unimplemented. You've come too far. Go back a page.
