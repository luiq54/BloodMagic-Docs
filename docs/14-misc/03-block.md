## Bloodstone Bricks {#bloodstone-bricks}

Bloodstone Bricks are a decorative block, and used as the capstones for the Tier-4 [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar).

They require Weak Blood Shards, which can be made by putting a [Saturated Tau](#saturated-tau) into an [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber) with a Sanguine Reverter in it.

## Teleposers {#teleposers}

_Teleposers_ allow for a form of Redstone Controlled teleportation. Simply craft a Teleposition Focus (below), bind it to your target teleposer, place it in another teleposer, and apply a redstone signal to the teleposer with a focus in it. Anything - blocks, items, entities, players - in a defined area above the two teleposers will be swapped.

Nothing comes for free, however; transporting blocks or entities via the teleposer will cost 1 LP each for every two blocks traversed, to a maximum of 1,000 LP per block/entity, or 10,000 LP total.

The basic _Teleposition Focus _will swap anything in a 1x1x1 block area above the two teleposers.

The _Enhanced Teleposition Focus_ will swap anything in a 3x3x3 block area centred directly above the two teleposers.

The _Reinforced Teleposition Focus_ will swap anything in a 5x5x5 block area centred directly above the two teleposers.

Teleposers can be linked one-way (such that a redstone signal to the exiting Teleposer does nothing), two-way (such that each Teleposer has a Focus in it linking to the other teleposer, making you teleport back and forth at a redstone signal from either end), or they can even be chained - A to B to C and back to A. From base-traversing elevator systems to complex underground labyrinths, go nuts!
