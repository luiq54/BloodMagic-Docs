title: Basic Ore Processing
---

The [Alchemy Table](#the-alchemy-table) can be used, amongst other things, for ore doubling, whilst the [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber) can give you 2.5 ingots per piece of Raw Ore or 4.5 ingots per Ore Block. Get more ore out of your mining expeditions with the power of blood!

## Basic Cutting Fluid

Basic Cutting Fluid is the penultimate step in all forms of Ore Processing.  It can also be used in the [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber) to get 3 Ore Sand from one Ore Block, or 1.5 Ore Sand from one Raw Ore (on average).

While a [Water Sigil](#water-sigil) is used in this demonstration, a simple Bottle of Water may be substituted in a pinch, though unlike the sigil, this will be consumed.


## Intermediate Cutting Fluid {#intermediate-cutting-fluid}

Intermediate Cutting Fluid is an improved version that lasts eight times as long and increases crafting speed by 50%. You'll have to go [Dungeon Delving](#heading=h.y9bhy9y8r2f4) for the [Tau Oil](#heading=h.i7uo4woy6qvz), though.


## Advanced Cutting Fluid {#advanced-cutting-fluid}

_Advanced Cutting Fluid_ lasts sixteen times as long, doubles crafting speed, and doubles the chance of getting bonus outputs from any recipes it's used in. You'll have to do some deep [Dungeon Delving](#dungeon-delving) for the [Hellforged Sand](#demonite) it needs.

## Ore to 3 Metal Sand {#ore-to-3-metal-sand}

Once you have access to the [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber), you can get 3 sand from every ore you mine.

## Explosive Powder {#explosive-powder}

Explosive Powder in the ARC is used to turn Ores into 4.5 Ore Fragments for on average, or Raw Ores into 2.25 ores on average, or turn Ingots into their Sand variant. It can also turn Netherrack into Sulfur and 50mb of Lava. It has 2 improved variants, below.

## Resonator {#resonator}

The Resonator is used to turn Ore Fragments into the relevant Gravel for continued ore processing, and creates tiny corrupted dust. The Reinforced Resonator has 4x durability, and the Hellforged resonator has 16x durability and doubles any bonus outputs.

## Corrupted Dust {#corrupted-dust}

Tiny Corrupted dust can be combined into Corrupted Dust, which can be used to further boost the yield of other ores. See below for some examples.

## Primitive Fuel Cell {#primitive-fuel-cell}

The ARC also functions as a Furnace, but the only fuel sources it accepts is the Primitive Fuel Cell or a [Lava Crystal.](#lava-crystal)

The Primitive Fuel Cell is good for 128 individual uses. That's more than the Block of Coal used to craft it (60 items), and since it only loses durability when the crafting is finished it will not waste fuel.
