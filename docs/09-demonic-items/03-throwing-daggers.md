Bows and Crossbows are fine enough in their way, but sifting through Gravel for Flint and plucking chickens for their Feathers is, frankly, beneath you. These shiny (and extremely sharp) Throwing Daggers also have some quite devious effects, if you do say so yourself.

The Iron Throwing Dagger is a fast-hitting attack, dealing 10 damage with a decent cooldown. Not only that, but if you have some [Demon Will](#demon-will) on you (be it in its raw form, or stored within a [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems), it will drop Will as a [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword) would.

The Syringe Throwing Dagger is for the Sanguimancer more interested in the acquisition of Life Essence than Will. While it deals slightly less damage, it is noticeably cheaper, and  enemies killed by this weapon have a chance of dropping a Slate Ampoule - or more, if they're hearty enough.

These delightful little vials can be crushed when near a [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar) in order to transfer 500 LP into it, destroying the Ampoule in the process. These gains are unaffected by any Runes you may have.


## Amethyst Throwing Dagger {#amethyst-throwing-dagger}

The _Amethyst Throwing Dagger_ does as much damage as an Iron Throwing Dagger, but mobs do not drop Will when killed. Instead, eight of them can be crafted with a [Lingering Alchemy Flask](#potion-crafting) in the [Alchemical Reaction Chamber](#alchemical-reaction-chamber) to create Tipped Amethyst Throwing Daggers.

These will transmit their effect to any mob they hit, the same as if they'd walked into the cloud left by a Lingering Alchemy Flask. Experiment with combined effects to find the most debilitating, diabolical daggers you can make!
