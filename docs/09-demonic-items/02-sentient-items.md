## Sentient Sword {#sentient-sword}

The Sentient Sword is a much more effective tool for collecting [Demon Will](#demon-will) than [Soul Snares](#your-first-will) could ever hope to be. It may seem weak at first, but it is powered by the Wills you carry, so crafting a [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems) is a must.

Note that the sword, as with all [Sentient Tools](#sentient-tools), can be repaired with [Crystallized Will](#crystallized-will) in an Anvil.

Note that you can update the sword's stats by right clicking when you have it equipped - if you have recently acquired a large amount of Will, or perhaps are trying out a new Aspect of Will for the first time, then this may be a good idea."

The [Sentient Sword](#sentient-sword) has proven to be a resounding success. You find yourself wondering how other tools may react to a similar treatment...

## Sentient Pickaxe {#sentient-pickaxe}

This pickaxe improves with Will, cutting through stone with ease. With no Will to power it, it is only slightly better than the Iron Pickaxe it was crafted from; However, with a full enough [Tartaric Gem](#tartaric-gems), you foresee it surpassing even a Netherite Pickaxe.


## Sentient Scythe {#sentient-scythe}

The Sentient Scythe is a slightly different tool to its iron counterpart. Infusing it with Will has transmuted it into a fearsome weapon. While slow and not as powerful as the other weapons, itâ€™s great swings will deal full damage to all enemies in its range, making it an excellent choice for crowd control.

## Sentient Axe {#sentient-axe}

Much like the Sentient Pickaxe, the Sentient Axe is a noticeable improvement over its Iron counterpart. Additionally, it gets a significant buff in its damage output, making it a fearsome weapon for those who don't mind its unwieldy nature.
