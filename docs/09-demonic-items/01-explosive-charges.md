Mining and foresting is all well and good for those who refuse to dream big, but what self-respecting sanguimancer would ever stoop to that?

With this in mind, you have devised some devious little devices. Simply throw them at some pesky trees, rocks, or whatever else you wish to cease to be and wait for them to self-ignite.

Not only that, you can improve their functionality by Anointing them with certain ingredients and a little Will, as described after each entry.

The currently available anointments are as follows:



* Fortunate - broken blocks are affected by Fortune I.
* Heated Tool - Broken blocks are Smelted.
* Soft Touch - Broken blocks are affected by Silk Touch.
* Voiding - 'Junk' blocks are voided rather than dropping as items.


## Shaped Charge {#shaped-charge}

The Shaped Charge will destroy a 5x5x5 cube facing whichever side of a block it lands on, dropping all blocks as though mined with a pickaxe. It even works on Obsidian, and provides a most satisfying **_KABOOM_** whilst doing so.

The _Augmented Shaped Charge_ is a direct upgrade from the standard Shaped Charge. It will destroy a 7x7x7 cube facing whichever side of a block it lands on, dropping all blocks as though mined with a pickaxe. It can also be anointed with Fortune II.

## Deforester Charge {#deforester-charge}

![Image](/img/DemonicItems/ExplosiveCharges/10.png)

The Deforester Charge is for felling trees. It can be used on logs or leaves, and will fell all but the mightiest of trees, breaking up to two stacks of logs at a time (and neatly stripping away any leaves it encounters in the process!) Even the giant trees of the Jungle will fall in a matter of seconds.

## Deforester Charge II {#deforester-charge-ii}

![Image](/img/DemonicItems/ExplosiveCharges/13.png)

The Deforester Charge II, much like the standard Deforester Charge, is for breaking wood and trees. It can break up to 8x64 logs, clearing away any connecting leaves. Excellent for making yourself a nice clearing in any Dark Oak Forest or Jungle you might happen to like the look of.

## Controlled Charge {#controlled-charge}

The Controlled Charge only destroys blocks _identical to the block it lands on_. It will destroy up to _three stacks_ of blocks, seeking out from the original point. As with other charges, all mined blocks will be dropped.

![Image](/img/DemonicItems/ExplosiveCharges/22.png)

The Fungal Charge is for felling giant mushrooms, both in the Overworld and the Nether. Although doubtful that you will ever reach this in a single charge, it can break up to _three stacks of blocks_.
