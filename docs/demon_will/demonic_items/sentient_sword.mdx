The $(item)Sentient Sword$() is a much more effective tool for collecting $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/demon_will)Demon Will$() than $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_snare)Soul Snares$() could ever hope to be. It may seem weak at first, but it is powered by the Wills you carry, so crafting a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_gem)Tartaric Gem$() is a must. $(br2) Note that the sword, as with all $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/sentient_tools)Sentient Tools$(), can be repaired with $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/crystallized_will)Crystallized Will$() in an Anvil.
