$(item)Bows$() and $(item)Crossbows$() are fine enough in their way, but sifting through $(item)Gravel$() for $(item)Flint$() and plucking chickens for their $(item)Feathers$() is, frankly, beneath you. These shiny (and extremely sharp) $(item)Throwing Daggers$() also have some quite devious effects, if you do say so yourself.
