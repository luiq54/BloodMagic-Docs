The $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/sentient_sword)Sentient Sword$() has proven to be a resounding success. You find yourself wondering how other tools may react to a similar treatment... $(br2) Note that these tools, as with the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/sentient_sword)Sentient sword$(), can be repaired with $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/crystallized_will)Crystallized Will$() in an Anvil. $(br2)Did we mention that Sentient Tools and Weapons are all highly enchantable?
The $(item)Sentient Scythe$() is a slightly different tool to its iron counterpart. Infusing it with will has transmuted it into a fearsome weapon. While slow and not as powerful as the other weapons, its great swings will deal full damage all enemies in its range, making it an excellent choice for crowd control.
Much like the $(item)Sentient Pickaxe$(), the $(item)Sentient Axe$() is a noticeable improvement over its Iron counterpart. Additionally, it gets a significant buff in its damage output, making it a fearsome weapon for those who don't mind its unwieldy nature.
Much like the $(item)Sentient Pickaxe$(), the $(item)Sentient Shovel$() is a noticeable improvement over its Iron counterpart, even without additional $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/demon_will)Demon Will$() to power it.
