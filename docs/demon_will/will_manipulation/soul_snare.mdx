Using the $(item)Snare$() is simple enough - craft a good quantity of them and throw them at $(thing)hostile mobs$(). White particle effects will appear around them; then it's time to go in for the kill. On death, they will drop a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/demon_will)Demon Will$(). Before you ask, yes, the Looting enchantment will increase the amount of $(raw)Will$() dropped. Once you've gathered a couple, you can get to work on crafting yourself a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/demonic_items/sentient_sword)Sentient Sword$() and a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_gem)Tartaric Gem$() - these will make collecting $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/demon_will)Demon Will$() much easier.
