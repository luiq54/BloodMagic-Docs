While in the player's inventory, the $(item)Demon Will Aura Gauge$() will display a HUD element to show how much $(raw)Demon Will$() is in the local $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/aura)Aura$(). $(br2)From top to bottom, the measured Will aspects are: $(li)$(raw)Raw$() $(li)$(corrosive)Corrosive$() $(li)$(steadfast)Steadfast$() $(li)$(destructive)Destructive$() $(li)$(vengeful)Vengeful$()
This gauge will appear in the top left of your screen. The coloured bars will give you a good estimate of how much of each $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/aspected_will)Will Aspect$() is in the current chunk. $(br2)You can hold [$(k:sneak)] to get a numerical value for each Aspect, between 1 and 100 $(raw)Will$() for each. 100 is the maximum amount of any one aspect of $(raw)Will$() that a chunk can have in it.
