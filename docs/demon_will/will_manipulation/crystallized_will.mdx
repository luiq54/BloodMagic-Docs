Now that you have plenty of $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/demon_will)Demon Will$() in your $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_gem)Tartaric Gem$(), it's time to explore what happens when you unleash it upon the world. $(br2)First off, you'll need to get $(raw)Will$() into the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/aura)Aura$().  Next, you'll need to make a $(thing)Demon Crystallizer$().

If you have more than 512 total $(raw)Will$() in your inventory (Across any number of $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/will_manipulation/soul_gem)Tartaric Gems$() and of any one type), you can harvest these crystals by right-clicking the spire with an empty hand. This will remove all but the central spire. $(br2)However, if you do not have enough $(raw)will$(), $(italic)really$() need that central spire's Crystal, or are just in a hurry, you can harvest the whole lot with a pickaxe.
