The $(item)Tag Item Filter$() lets you select up to 9 items and filter by their associated $(thing)Tags$(). Similarly to the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/standard_item_filter)Standard Item Filter$(), it has a quantity selector and an allow/deny function. Leaving the quantity blank defaults to 'all'. $(br2)For each item that you put into this filter, you can select whether to match items based on $(thing)one specific tag$(), or $(thing)any of its tags$().
