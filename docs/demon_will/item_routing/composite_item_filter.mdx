title: Composite Item Filter

The $(item)Composite Item Filter$() does nothing on its own, but when combined with another type of $(item)Filter$(), it allows you to apply that filter's rules to it. $(br2)This means you can, for example, use the Enchantment Filter's 'Any Enchantments' and the Tag Filter's 'forge:swords' to only allow enchanted swords to pass through.

Similarly to the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/standard_item_filter)Standard Item Filter$(), it has a quantity selector and an allow/deny function. Leaving the quantity blank defaults to 'all'. Other buttons will appear on the GUI as you combine it with other filters.
