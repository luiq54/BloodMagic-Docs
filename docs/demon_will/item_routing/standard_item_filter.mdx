The Standard Item Filter lets you select up to 9 items to withdraw from, or insert into, the adjacent inventory when inserted into a $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/routing_nodes)Routing Node$(). $(br2)Each item has a quantity - leaving this blank will default to 'all'. $(br2)The Filter also has an Allow and Deny function. In Deny mode, quantities are ignored. 

When used in an $(item)Output Routing Node$(), the quantity tells the node how many of that item to fill in the selected inventory with. Anything above this amount will be left in the network - either passed into another valid inventory, or left where it is.
