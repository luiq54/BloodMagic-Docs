The $(item)Mod Item Filter$() lets you select up to 9 items from different mods. Similarly to the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/standard_item_filter)Standard Item Filter$(), it has a quantity selector and an allow/deny function. Leaving the quantity blank defaults to 'all'. $(br2)For each item that you put into this filter, $(thing)any item from the same mod$() will be matched.
