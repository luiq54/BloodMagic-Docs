The $(item)Node Router$() is used to link Nodes together into a Network. Its functionality is straightforward - Simply hold [$(k:sneak)] and [$(k:use)] while aiming at  a node, then do the same to another node within 16 blocks. These two nodes are now linked. If you want to de-select a node, [$(k:use)] on any other block. See the entry on $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/routing_nodes)Routing Nodes$() for more information.
