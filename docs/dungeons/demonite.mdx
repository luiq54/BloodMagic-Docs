$(item)Demonite Ore$() can only be found within $(thing)Dungeons$(), specifically in $(thing)The Mines$(), accessed by finding a $(item)Foreman's Key$() somewhere within the mazelike structure and using it to unlock a $(thing)Spatial Distortion$(). It can be used to make $(item)Hellforged Ingots$() or $(item)Hellforged Sand$(). $(br2)When mined with Silk Touch, the ore can be harvested directly, but otherwise, it will drop clumps of $(item)Raw Demonite$().
