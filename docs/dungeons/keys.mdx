$(item)Keys$() are the initial way of navigating $(thing)Dungeons$(). They can be found inside Dungeon chests within the $(thing)Demon Realm$(), or they can be crafted. The most basic kind are $(item)Iron Keys$(), which spawn inside $(thing)The Antechamber$() as well as within the closest levels of the $(thing)Demon Realm$() proper.
Eventually, you may come across a $(thing)Spatial Distortion$() when searching through a Dungeon. These will either lead you to a unique, uncraftable key, or to a door that only said key can open. Spatial Distortions only form within the Demon Realm proper, and you will never find them within an Antechamber.
