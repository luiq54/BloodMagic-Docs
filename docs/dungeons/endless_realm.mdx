Much as with its little brother, the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_simple_dungeon)Edge of the Hidden Realm$() ritual, you can access the $(thing)Demon Realm$() proper with the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_standard_dungeon)Pathway to the Endless Realm$(). you will once again find yourself looking at an $(thing)Inversion Pillar$(). As with the $(thing)Antechamber$(), you'll find a simple loot chest left by a careless demon (or perhaps a less-lucky sanguimancer) and a number of doorways, alongside

another Inversion Pillar to return you home. $(br2)These dungeon rooms will be filled with more fearsome foes than you found in the antechamber, and will have loot to match. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for any $(thing)Spatial Distortions$(), as well as rare $(l:bloodmagic:dungeons/keys)keys$() such as the $(item)Foreman's Key$().

Spatial Distortions will announce themselves with a chat message - if you see one of these messages, it means the room you're in has a very special lock. Currently, it will be either the entrance to $(thing)The Mines$(), or the entrance to a small room containing $(thing)The Foreman's Key$(), which can be opened with an $(thing)Iron Key$(). The Mine entrance will always spawn before the key, so some backtracking might be needed. 

The Foreman's Key will allow entrance into $(thing)The Mines$(), which is another step up in both difficulty and rewards. Along with $(l:bloodmagic:dungeons/demonite)Demonite Ore$(), which is essential for high tier $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/potions)potioncrafting$() and $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_altar)the Tier-5 Blood Altar$() and its accompanying $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Orb$(), you'll find scads of more mundane loot, enchanted weapons and tools, anointments, potions, and more.
