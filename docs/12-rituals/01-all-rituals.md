title: List of Rituals
---



Some simpler Rituals will be available to you when you have a Tier III [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar), but the more advanced ones will require Dusk Runes, and thus a Tier IV Altar.

Use a [Ritual Diviner](#ritual-diviner) to assemble the rituals, an [Activation Crystal](#activation-crystals) to activate them, and a [Ritual Tinkerer](#ritual-tinkerer) to fine-tune them. Don't forget to keep your [Soul Network](#soul-network) topped off!

Activation Cost: 250000 LP

Using the vast powers at your disposal, the most conclusion is that it is a good idea to summon a meteor from outer space to crash upon the world.

By dropping an appropriate offering on top of the MRS, the ritual will consume the item (plus a large amount of LP, default of a million LP) and summon a meteor at the build height of the map. Once the meteor hits something, it will detonate and leave behind many resources to mine and process.

The size and resources gained vary based on the offering given. Normal offerings include: Diamond, Block of Iron, Glowstone Dust, and Stone.

Mod items include: Dragon Bones (Ice and Fire), Certus Quartz (AE2), Andesite Alloy (Create), Copper Wire Coil (Immersive Engineering), Prosperity Shard (Mystical Agriculture), RF Coil (Thermal), and Advanced Alloy (Mekanism).

[For a full list of sacrificial items, LP costs, and expected resources, see [our github](https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/tree/1.16.3/src/generated/resources/data/bloodmagic/recipes/meteor). Note the existence of meteors for other mods, such as Mekanism or Ice and Fire.]

Activation Cost: 10000 LP

Base Usage Cost: 10 LP

Base Interval: 1 Tick

This ritual consumes excess Upgrade Points (in the form of Tomes, Scraps, and Synthetic Upgrade Points) in order to apply Downgrades to your [Living Armour](#living-basics). These downgrades will harshly limit your abilities, but will provide you with a wealth of additional Upgrade Points to play around with, allowing for much more specialisation than was previously available to you.

![Image](/img/Rituals/12.png)

If you do not have enough points available to you, you can craft Synthetic Upgrade Points. Each one of these is worth a single Upgrade Point.

To use the ritual, simply place your tomes (or other sources of Upgrade Points) and the required Item(s) for the particular downgrade you have in mind into the attached chest (see the previous page), while wearing your Living Armour. The ritual will consume the points and apply the downgrade to your armour. The order of consumption is: Living Armour Upgrade Scraps, then Living Armour Upgrade Tomes, and finally Synthetic Upgrade Points.

Excess points will be returned in the form of Living Armour Upgrade Scraps.

The downgrades applied to your armour depends on what Item(s) you place in the chest. Each item that matches a particular downgrade will increase the desired downgrade's level by one. In this manner, multiple downgrades can be applied at once with a single ritual activation.

The ritual will respect any settings you have configured on your [Living Armour Training Bracelet](#training-bracelet), so if you have it set to 'do not allow other upgrades' then the ritual will fail to apply the downgrades to you. If in doubt, put your Training Bracelet away!

Water runes: 1

Fire Runes: 12

Earth Runes: 11

Dusk Runes: 1

Total runes: 25

[Weak Activation Crystal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOd63XVV79AE4w0Fb1zWWha737cGXbWUFoIHhtu9cw8/edit#heading=h.6puwnp7e4wj5)

Activation Cost: 15000 LP

Base Usage Cost: 10 LP

Base Interval: 4 Ticks

The _Rythm of the Beating Anvil_ is a powerful and versatile ritual, allowing you to autocraft standard crafting recipes alongside recipes using your [Alchemy Table](#the-alchemy-table) or [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge) (If properly augmented). However, it can be a little complex, so what follows is a tutorial for setting it up.

Each ritual can handle exactly one recipe.

First off, we need to specify the recipe that we want the ritual to craft. This is done using an Item Filter.

Multiple types of Item Filter can be used, however the ritual will only ever accept one filter at a time; any additional filters will be ignored.

The following filters are accepted:



* Standard Item Filter: specifies exactly which item to use in each slot.
* Tag Item Filter: Uses _Tags_ to specify what items to use. E.G. If a recipe requires any kind of stone (but will work with andesite, granite, etc), you can use forge:stone in the filter.
* Mod Item Filter: This will try to use any item from the same mod in this slot.


### Sample Filter {#sample-filter}

![Image](/img/Rituals/14.png)

_A Standard Item Filter configured to autocraft Stone Pickaxes._

Next, the Item Filter has to be placed on the ritual. In this image we've used an Item Frame, however a chest can be used instead. Note that if you put multiple filters in the chest, only the first one will be used.

By default, the Input chest and Output chest are in the same place; however, this can be changed with the [Ritual Tinkerer](#ritual-tinkerer). This can be useful for recipes that re-use some components, such as your [Blood Orb](#soul-network).


### The Placed Filter {#the-placed-filter}


![Image](/img/Rituals/15.png)

_A filter and chest in normal locations, and a [Tinkered](#ritual-tinkerer) ritual with separate input and output chests._

If you supply the ritual with Steadfast or Corrosive Will, then the ritual will instead try to autocraft with a linked [Hellfire Forge](#hellfire-forge) or [Alchemy Table](#alchemy-table), respectively. These recipes are all shapeless, but if you need 2 of an item, you'll have to specify it twice in the filter.


### Alchemy Filter {#alchemy-filter}
