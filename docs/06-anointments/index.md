Anointments are essentially potions for your tools, weapons, and even your [Charges](#explosive-charges). By holding right click with the anointment in one hand, it will be applied to the item in your other hand, if possible. Not all anointments work on all equipment!

Unlike potions, anointments aren't timed; rather, they wear off a bit at a time as your tool or weapon is used.
