title: Sigils
---


Sigils are formed using an [Alchemy Array](#crafting-with-arrays), some form of Reagent and a [Slate](#slates). They draw LP from your [Soul Network](#soul-network) in order to perform all sorts of useful tasks.


## Air Sigil {#air-sigil}

Throws you in the direction you're facing, at a cost of 50 LP per use. Note that this does not provide any sort of Feather Falling effect, so be careful when landing! A good way to get around quickly, albeit with some risk. Many an unwary mage has met their end by running out of LP in their [Soul Network](#soul-network) while flying miles above the countryside.

## Divination Sigil {#divination-sigil}

The Divination Sigil is probably the first of many sigils that you would like to craft in Blood Magic. In order to craft the sigil, you need to create an [Alchemy Array](#alchemy-arrays) and use Redstone Dust and a Blank Slate as the base and catalyst items, respectively.

_Peer into the soul._

The Divination Sigil has two primary uses:

* When any player right-clicks while aiming at the air with a bound sigil, it will display the amount of LP that is in the owner's [Soul Network](#soul-network).
* When right-clicking on a [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar), it will tell the player the altar's current Tier, the amount of Life Essence stored in the altar, as well as its current max capacity.

Having a Divination Sigil on hand can also be helpful for the [Incense Altar](#incense-altar).

_The Divination Sigil displays this HUD when you are looking at a Blood Altar._

Finally, when shift-right-clicking, a new interface opens displaying all available HUD elements from Blood Magic. An element can be selected and moved by clicking and dragging the element. Releasing the element and clicking "Save" will save the element's new location.

Selecting "Default" returns the elements to their default positions.

_the various GUI elements of Blood Magic._

The elements, going top to bottom, then left to right, are as follows:
* [The Incense Altar](#incense-altar) (light grey)
* [The Seer's Sigil](#seer's-sigil) (purple)
* The Divination Sigil (lavender)
* [The Demon Will Aura Gauge](#demon-will-aura-gauge) (orange)
* [The Sigil of Holding](#sigil-of-holding) (green)


## Lava Sigil {#lava-sigil}

The sister sigil to the [Water Sigil](#water-sigil). Right-click when holding the Lava Sigil to create a source block of lava on the ground, for the cost of 1000 LP. Crafted in an [Alchemy Array](#alchemy-arrays) using a Lava Reagent and a Blank Slate, it'll drain 5 hearts from you if you don't have enough LP in your [Soul Network](#soul-network).

What's more, it can be used in the [Alchemy Table](#the-alchemy-table) to automate the production of Lava Buckets. The Sigil is not consumed in this recipe.

If you have the Curios API installed, you can equip this Sigil as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using a [Sigil of Holding](#sigil-of-holding), or the [Socketed Upgrade](#socketed) for your [Living Armour](#living-basics).


## Seer's Sigil {#seer's-sigil}

The Seer's Sigil is a more advanced form of the [Divination Sigil](#divination-sigil). Alongside showing the amount of LP in the bound player's [Soul Network](#soul-network), it also shows more information when looking at a [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar).

Like the Divination Sigil, it can also be used to edit your GUI. (See the Divination Sigil's entry for more info.)

_The Seer's Sigil displays this HUD when you are looking at a Blood Altar._

From top to bottom, we have:



* The current Tier of the [Blood Altar](#the-blood-altar).
* The amount of blood currently inside the Altar, and the current total capacity of the Altar. (This defaults to 10,000mb, but may be increased with [Runes of Capacity](#rune-of-capacity) and


[Runes of Augmented Capacity](#heading=h.m5veu3pud5e4).
* The current crafting progress, if any.
* LP Consumption/Tick - how much LP the Altar will use per tick when crafting.
* Current LP Storage of any [Charging Runes](#charging-rune) you may have.


## Sigil of Holding {#sigil-of-holding}

This Sigil can hold up to 5 other Sigils at a time, providing you with their passive effects and allowing you to activate them on a whim.

Press the ‘open sigil’ keybind while holding the Sigil to open its inventory. (You can find out what this is bound to by checking your in-game menu. The in-game guidebook would update accordingly, but i’m just a google doc, what do I know?)

Press the ‘cycle forward’ keybind to cycle forward, or the ‘cycle backwards’ keybind to cycle backwards. sneaking and using your mousewheel also works.

_Sigil-ception_

If you have the Curios API installed, you can equip this Sigil as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using a [Sigil of Holding](#sigil-of-holding), or the [Socketed Upgrade](#socketed) for your [Living Armour](#living-basics).


## Sigil of Magnetism {#sigil-of-magnetism}

Increases the player's item pickup range to 7 blocks when active. Toggle on/off by holding the Sigil in your hand, and then shift-right-clicking.

Consumes 50 LP every 5 seconds while active.

## Sigil of Suppression {#sigil-of-suppression}

The _Sigil of Suppression_, when activated via right-click, will temporarily obliviate all fluids in a roughly 6-block radius of its holder. A short while after moving away from the liquid in question, it will return as though it never left. While this will make exploring the lava oceans of the Nether much easier, beware of jumping into any deep pools of water with this active!

_Better than a Void Sigil®!_


## Sigil of the Blood Lamp {#sigil-of-the-blood-lamp}

The Sigil of the Blood Lamp is a handy tool for any miner, dungeon delver, or simply any Sanguimancer that doesn't like dark patches and feels that torches and glowstone blocks get in the way. When used, this sigil launches a Blood Light in the direction you are facing. When it hits a block, it spawns a nearly-invisible light source at a cost of 10 LP.

_I see a light!_


## Sigil of the Fast Miner {#sigil-of-the-fast-miner}

The Sigil of the Fast Miner is a Sigil that, when activated by shift-right-clicking, will consume 100 LP every 5 seconds and apply the Haste potion effect. Thus, it increases your mining, digging, and cutting speeds. Crafted using the Mining Reagent and Reinforced Slate in an alchemy array.

## Sigil of the Green Grove {#sigil-of-the-green-grove}

The Sigil of the Green Grove is an item that has multiple uses. Crafted in an array with a Growth Reagent and a Reinforced Slate, the sigil can use your Soul Network's LP to nourish and grow nearby plants.

[N.B. any vanilla saplings should work for the reagent recipe.]

_The Sigil of the Green Grove's array, plus its primary uses._

If you right-click on a block that is ‘IGrowable’, it will apply the bonemeal effect while consuming 150 LP.

However, if you sneak and right-click while aiming at the air, it will light up to indicate that it is activated, and will consume 150 LP every 5 seconds until deactivated. Every block in a 7x7x5 high volume centred on the player will have a growth tick applied to it. Good for farming those taters!

If you have the Curios API installed, you can equip this Sigil as a charm. If you want to wear more curios at once, consider using a [Sigil of Holding](#sigil-of-holding), or the [Socketed Upgrade](#socketed) for your [Living Armour](#living-basics).


## Teleposition Sigil {#teleposition-sigil}

Teleports the user to a linked [Teleposer](#teleposers) at a cost of 1000 LP per use. By shift-clicking on a Teleposer with the sigil in hand, the location and dimension of the Teleposer can be recorded, allowing for a quick escape back home.

Just don't move the Teleposer by accident…

_Now you see me…!_


## Void Sigil {#void-sigil}

The Void sigil, when you right-click on any fluid, will destroy it at a cost of 50LP per block. Good for clearing out irksome lava flows without all that tedious placing and breaking of individual blocks.

## Water Sigil {#water-sigil}

The Water Sigil is a rather simple sigil. When you right click on a block, you can drain 100LP from your [Soul Network](#soul-network) to place a source block of water in the world. If there's not enough LP, it will instead drain the toll from your health. Crafted using a Water Reagent and a Blank Slate.
