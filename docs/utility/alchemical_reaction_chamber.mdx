The $(item)Alchemical Reaction Chamber$() isn't fully implemented yet, but among other things it can function as a $(thing)Furnace$(), offers a form of $(l:bloodmagic:utility/ore_processing)Ore-Tripling$(), can revert $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Blood Orbs$(), $(item)Netherrite$() and $(item)Reinforced Runes$(), and is currently the only way to get $(blood)Weak Blood Shards$(), specifically from a $(l:bloodmagic:dungeons/tau_fruit)Saturated Tau$().
Should you wish to automate the ARC, perhaps as part of an $(l:bloodmagic:utility/ore_processing)Ore-Tripling$() chain, you may want to know that it is $(thing)sided$(), much like a $(item)furnace$(). Tools can only be inserted or extracted from the top, inputs from the sides, and outputs from the bottom. Keep this in mind when placing your $(item)Hoppers$() or $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/routing_nodes)Routing Nodes$().
