$(blood)Blood Magic 3$()'s progression is still being reworked, and the first few steps are significantly different from $(blood)Blood Magic 2$()'s. $(br2)We are still retooling our guidance, but we are waiting until the progression is locked down. In the meantime, here is a quick overview on how to progress in $(blood)Blood Magic 3$().

If that's not enough, you can use the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_upgrade_remove)Sound of the Cleansing Soul$() to strip your armour of its upgrades. These tomes can be copied into a $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/training_bracelet)Training Bracelet$(), or re-applied to your armour to ensure you only train Upgrades that you actually want. $(br2)Any leftover $(thing)Upgrade Tomes$() can be kept as fuel for the $(l:bloodmagic:rituals/ritual_list/ritual_living_downgrade)Penance of the Leaden Soul$(). This ritual allows you to apply $(thing)Downgrades$() to your Armour.

While these are expensive (and each comes with a hefty penalty), their negative point-cost will give you more room to further improve your upgrades. $(br2)Want to be incredibly tough and healthy, and don't mind being slow? Try combining $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/body_builder)Body Builder$() V, $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/brilliance)Brilliance$() V, $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/healthy)Healthy$() X, and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/tough)Tough$() X with $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armour_downgrades/dig_slowdown)Leadened Pick$() X and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armour_downgrades/speed_decreas e)Limp Leg$() X.

Feel more like exploring and going fast? Perhaps you don't care about your offhand? Maybe $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/strong_legs)Strong Legs$() X, $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armor_upgrades/quick_feet)Quick Feet$() X, and $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_array/living_equipment/armour_downgrades/crippled_arm)Crippled Arm$() would be more your speed. $(br2)Feel like having both at different times? Make multiple chestplates and swap between them! There are dozens of upgrades and downgrades, so mix and match to find your favourite combinations.
