$(item)Teleposers$() allow for a form of $(fire)Redstone Controlled$() teleportation. Simply craft a $(item)Teleposition Focus$() (overleaf), bind it to your target teleposer, place it in another teleposer, and apply a redstone signal to the teleposer with a focus in it. Anything - blocks, items, entities, players - in a defined area above the two teleposers will be swapped.

Teleposers can be linked one-way (such that a redstone signal to the exiting Teleposer does nothing), two-way (such that each Teleposer has a Focus in it linking to the other teleposer, making you teleport back and forth at a redstone signal from either end), or they can even be chained - A to B to C and back to A. From base-traversing elevator systems to complex underground labrynths, go nuts!

If you're having difficulty getting your Teleposer to work, make sure that it is being $(thing)strongly redstone powered$(). This means that placing a redstone block next to the block won't power it - you'll need redstone dust or a repeater pointing into the side of the Teleposer, or a lever or  button directly on it. Life Essense isn't free after all, so the Teleposer is designed to minimize accidental misfires.
