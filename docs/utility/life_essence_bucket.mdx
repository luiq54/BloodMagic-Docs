$(blood)Life Essence$() is all fine and good in the $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_altar)Blood Altar$(), where it can be used for crafting or funnelled into an $(l:bloodmagic:altar/soul_network)Orb$() to power $(thing)Rituals$(), but what if you want to build a moat of the stuff around your $(l:bloodmagic:utility/incense_altar)Incense Altar$()? Fortunately, extracting $(blood)Life Essence$() is relatively trivial. Simply place a $(item)Bucket$() in the $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_altar)Blood Altar$() and wait a few seconds for it to fill up. $(blood)1 LP$()=1mb, so $(blood)1,000 LP$() should be plenty for your $(item)Bucket$().
