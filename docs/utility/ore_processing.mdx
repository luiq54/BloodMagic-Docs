The $(l:bloodmagic:alchemy_table/alchemy_table)Alchemy Table$() can be used, amongst other things, for ore doubling, whilst the $(l:bloodmagic:utility/alchemical_reaction_chamber)Alchemical Reaction Chamber$() can give you 2.5 ingots per piece of $(item)Raw Ore$(), or 4.5 ingots per $(item)Ore Block$(). Get more ore out of your mining expeditions with the power of blood!
The $(item)Primitive Fuel Cell$() is good for 128 individual uses. That's more than the $(item)Block of Coal$() used to craft it (60 items), and since it only loses durability when the crafting is finished it will not waste fuel.
