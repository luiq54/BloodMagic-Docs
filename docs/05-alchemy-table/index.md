title: Alchemy Table
---


The Alchemy Table crafts items using LP from a [Soul Network](#soul-network). The Soul Network used and Tier of recipes available are determined by the Blood Orb inserted on the right side of the GUI.

The Alchemy Table is used to craft a handful of Blood Magic components, and provides alternate recipes for some vanilla items as well.

When looking at Alchemy Table recipes in this book (or in JEI), please hover over the arrow with an "LP" label to view Time, LP drain, and Tier information.

_The Alchemy Table can be inserted into or extracted from using these buttons._

The Alchemy Table has a number of buttons on its right hand side. These are, in order, **D**own, **U**p, **N**orth, **S**outh, **W**est, and **E**ast. To use them, first click on any slot in the Alchemy Table. (Here, we have selected the central 'finished item' slot, for demonstration.)

Next, click on one of these six buttons to toggle whether or not the Alchemy Table should allow Hoppers, pipes, or other such external interference from this face.

To return to the table's normal function, simply click the slot again to deselect it. The icon displayed in the slot shows whether it is accepting inputs or providing outputs. In the example picture, we are allowing pipes to take from our central slot only on the **D**own slot, and any attempts to extract items from other sides will not succeed.

_The Alchemy Table will tell you when something is wrong._

The two most common reasons for a recipe to not work in the Alchemy Table are as follows:

* **Orb Error**: Either there is no Blood Orb present in the relevant slot, or the Orb you are trying to use is not a high enough level for this recipe.
* **Soul Network Error**: The orb is of a valid level, but either you have not bound it to yourself (right click while holding it), or your Soul Network does not have enough LP in it.

The following pages document a number of recipes currently available for the Alchemy Table.

The [Lava](#lava-sigil) and [Water Sigils](#water-sigil) are not consumed in either of these recipes. What's more, the Water Sigil can be used in place of a Water Bucket in any Alchemy Table Recipe
