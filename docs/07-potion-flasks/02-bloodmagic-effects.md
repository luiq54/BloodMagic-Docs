## Bounce {#bounce}

If the target would take fall damage, _Bounce_ will instead cause them to spring harmlessly off the ground. Whee!

Crouching before impact will prevent you from bouncing.

## Flight {#flight}

_Flight_ gives the target a temporary dose of creative-style Flight, similar to if they were within the range of the [Reverence of the Condor](#reverence-of-the-condor) ritual. Higher levels increase flight speed.

## Gravity {#gravity}

_Gravity_ causes the target to fall faster and take more damage on landing. It does not reduce jump height, however.

It's created from a flask containing both the [Grounded](#grounded) and [Slow Falling](#slow-falling) effects.

It's created from a flask containing both the [Gravity](#gravity) and [Instant Health](#instant-health) effects.

## Spectral Sight {#spectral-sight}

_Spectral Sight_ illuminates nearby creatures as though they had the Glowing buff. The base range is 24 blocks, and higher levels increase the range by an additional 32 blocks per level.

It's made from a potion of [Night Vision](#night-vision).

## Suspended {#suspended}

_Suspended_ prevents the target from jumping, falling, or being affected by gravity in any way whatsoever. They can still move, however, sliding about as though on a flat, never-ending plane of ice.

It's made from a potion of [Gravity](#gravity).
