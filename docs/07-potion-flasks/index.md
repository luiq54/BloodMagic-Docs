title: Potion Flasks

The basics of _Potion Crafting_ are known to all and sundry throughout the land. Even common Clerics and Witches have a firm grasp of the basics of brewing - take a handful of semi-rare ingredients, mix them together in the correct proportions, and consume the result (while holding your nose, if needed), or throw it at your foes.

The addition of Life Essence and some frankly ingenious Sanguimancy has allowed you to turbocharge the practice, however.

By imbuing ordinary Glass Bottles with your powers, you are able to hold far more than a single swig of liquid, and with the use of various Catalysts you have figured out how to combine multiple effects in one flask without them muddying together and cancelling out.

A sturdy Flask that is far more capacious than any measly bottle!

Of course, a bottle, no matter how advanced, is all but useless without something to fill it.

Alongside all the usual well known Effects such as Water Breathing, Regeneration, or Night Vision, we have also perfected a variety of other, more specialised recipes, such as Flight, Obsidian Cloak, or even Passive. These potions and many more are documented further on in the book.

Once you have used up any kind of _Alchemy Flask_, simply wash out and refill it with water, to get a fresh new flask ready for use.

Flasks also have their equivalent to _Splash _and _Lingering Potions_.

You may recall me mentioning the ability to make multiple effects in a single Flask. Luckily, this process couldn't be easier. Simply brew up a potion, and use the resulting Flask in place of your empty Flask in the second brewing. For example, if you made a Flask of Bounce, then took that flask and used it as an ingredient in a flask of Night Vision, you'd end up with an 8-dose Flask that gives you Bounce and Night Vision with every swig!

Next up, we have _Catalysts_. There are a few kinds of catalyst, with a few different effects, so let's start off with the simplest three - _Simple Catalyst_, _Small Power Catalyst_, and _Small Lengthening Catalyst_. Of these, the first is the most straightforward - it provides a base to almost every Alchemical Potion, much as Nether Wart does for standard Potions.

A good base for nearly any effect. Stock up, you'll want a lot of these.

_Power Catalysts_ increase the potency of the topmost Effect inside the Flask, while decreasing the duration of the effect. It is roughly analogous to Glowstone in more standard potions. If the most recently applied effect cannot accept the catalyst, it will attempt to boost the second topmost, and so on.

_Lengthening Catalysts _increase the duration of the topmost effect inside the Flask. It is roughly analogous to Redstone in more standard potions. If the most recently applied effect cannot accept the catalyst, it will attempt to boost the second topmost, and so on.

_Combinational Catalysts_ are a little more niche - they take two defined effects and synthesise a third, related effect from them. For example, a Flask with Suspended and Levitation would, when brewed with this catalyst, produce a Flask of Flight.

_Filling Agents_ can be used to refresh the contents of a Flask, at the cost of losing some of the effects - the Weak Filling Agent can only preserve the topmost effect on the Flask. If you wish to preserve a different effect, consider using the Simple Cycling Catalyst.

The _Cycling Catalyst_ can be used to alter the order of effects inside the Flask, and thus change which effect will be altered by another Catalyst or Agent.
