If the potions you've crafted so far just aren't enough for you, then perhaps you need to do a little exploring? With some Glow berries, some Cobbled Deepslate and a sprinkling of Hellforged Sand, you can boost the duration and power of your flasks significantly.

A more potent base for more potent catalysts.

The Standard Lengthening Catalyst will increase the duration of the topmost effect from 3:00 to 21:20. Multiply that by the 8 doses each flask provides, and that's a heck of a long time!

The Standard Power Catalyst is a souped-up version of the Small Power Catalyst, allowing you to get up to level III potion effects in your flask, while reducing the duration to just 45 seconds per dose.
