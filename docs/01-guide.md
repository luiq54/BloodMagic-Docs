This is a bad cut-and-paste hack-job of the in-game Patchouli-based manual, the ‘Sanguine Scientum’. For the most up-to-date information, install Patchouli and check the guide. If recipes or values have been customised for your modpack, the book should show it, along with proper 3D renders of multiblocks that you can visualise in-world, a ‘press ctrl to quick-open this thing’s entry entry in the guide’ for every item in the mod, etc. But if you’re just looking for a quick reference when you’re not playing (for example to show someone else how something works) then this should do.
