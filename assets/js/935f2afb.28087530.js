Arrays","description":"Alchemy Arrays are simple effects that originate from circles that are drawn on the ground using Arcane Ashes. They are simple to build and can be really useful in both early game and late game applications","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"alchemy-table/index":{"id":"alchemy-table/index","title":"Alchemy Table","description":"The Alchemy Table crafts items using LP from a Soul Network. The Soul Network used and Tier of recipes available are determined by the Blood Orb inserted on the right side of the GUI.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"anointments/all-anoinments":{"id":"anointments/all-anoinments","title":"List of all Anoinments","description":"Archer\'s Polish {archer\'s-polish}","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"anointments/index":{"id":"anointments/index","title":"Anointments","description":"Anointments are essentially potions for your tools, weapons, and even your Charges. By holding right click with the anointment in one hand, it will be applied to the item in your other hand, if possible. Not all anointments work on all equipment!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blood-altar/blood-runes":{"id":"blood-altar/blood-runes","title":"Blood Runes","description":"There\'s lots of different runes. They do cool stuff! Try mixing and matching to see what works best for you.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blood-altar/index":{"id":"blood-altar/index","title":"Blood Altar","description":"One of the central concepts of Blood Magic is building a glorious ziggurat to focus your power. These pages will guide you in the construction of this masterwork.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demon-will/crystallized-will":{"id":"demon-will/crystallized-will","title":"Crystallized Will","description":"Now that you have plenty of Demon Will in your Tartaric Gem, it\'s time to explore what happens when you unleash it upon the world.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demon-will/demon-will-aspects":{"id":"demon-will/demon-will-aspects","title":"Demon Will Aspects","description":"Unleashing Demon Will into the atmosphere was definitely an excellent idea. Not only has it proven most useful in empowering Rituals, you have also successfully condensed it into a Crystal Cluster, and are wondering what to turn your eye to next.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demon-will/demon-will-aura":{"id":"demon-will/demon-will-aura","title":"Demon Will Aura","description":"As we have established, Demonic Will coalesces around certain creatures and propels them with malevolent force. However, this is not the only place that Will can exist. By burning Will in a Demon Crucible, it is possible to unleash the will into the Aura, to great and fascinating effect.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demon-will/index":{"id":"demon-will/index","title":"Demon Will","description":"Demonic will is strange stuff. Untapped, it seems to coalesce around entities, but it can be tapped, harnessed, and controlled. This chapter lays out the underlying concepts and advanced techniques for Demon Will manipulation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demon-will/tartaric-gems":{"id":"demon-will/tartaric-gems","title":"Tartaric Gems","description":"Demon Will is a very useful resource, but the fragments you have been getting so far are decidedly lacking in power. What you need is a storage item; A Tartaric Gem seems just the thing. What\'s more, it can absorb any leftover Demon Will you might have lying around. Just drop them onto the floor and your shiny new gem will absorb them.\\"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demonic-items/explosive-charges":{"id":"demonic-items/explosive-charges","title":"Explosive charges","description":"Mining and foresting is all well and good for those who refuse to dream big, but what self-respecting sanguimancer would ever stoop to that?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"demonic-items/index":{"id":"demonic-items/index","title":"Demonic Tools","description":"Demon Will is one of the first things you can create with Blood Magic. Once you have gathered some with a Soul Snare, you will be able to craft a Petty Tartaric Gem and a Sentient Sword.

This dangerous place is full of threats, traps, and treasure!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dungeon-delving/tau-fruit":{"id":"dungeon-delving/tau-fruit","title":"Tau Fruit","description":"Tau Fruit can be found within Simple Dungeons, after which it can be farmed.

As with the Antechamber, you\'ll find a simple loot chest left by a careless demon (or perhaps a less-lucky sanguimancer) and a number of doorways, alongside another Inversion Pillar to return you home.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide":{"id":"guide","title":"Blood Magic: Alchemical Wizardry","description":"Main Guide","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"item-routing":{"id":"item-routing","title":"Item Routing","description":"Who needs hoppers?

Fortunately, extracting Life Essence is relatively trivial. Simply place a Bucket in the Blood Altar and wait a few seconds for it to fill up. 1 LP=1mb, so 1,000 LP should be plenty for your Bucket.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"misc/incense-altar":{"id":"misc/incense-altar","title":"Incense Altar","description":"The Incense Altar is a multiblock structure that can be used to boost your self-sacrificing at a Blood Altar. By standing near your setup, the Incense Altar will calm your soul based on the area\'s total Tranquillity, allowing you to significantly increase your LP gains.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"misc/index":{"id":"misc/index","title":"Utility Blocks & Items","description":"AKA the \\"Miscellaneous\\" bin. General information about the mod goes here, along with anything else that doesn\'t quite fit in another category, yet doesn\'t have enough to warrant a category of its own.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"misc/lava-crystal":{"id":"misc/lava-crystal","title":"Lava Crystal","description":"The Lava Crystal is a source of great heat. Between the lava used in its creation and the power of your Soul Network, you feel confident that it will never cool.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"misc/nyi":{"id":"misc/nyi","title":"Not Yet Implemented","description":"OK. Breaking the fourth wall here. Blood Magic is still in an early alpha, and a lot of things you may recall from earlier versions are Not Yet Implemented.
