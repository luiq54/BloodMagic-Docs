By holding right click with the anointment in one hand, it will be applied to the item in your other hand, if possible. Not all anointments work on all equipment!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blood-altar/blood-runes":{"id":"blood-altar/blood-runes","title":"Blood Runes","description":"There\'s lots of different runes.
